<h1>The Ultimate In-N-Out Secret Menu (and Super Secret Menu!)</h1>

<p>I'm no stranger to In-N-Out, the massively popular California-based
fast food burger chain (that is apparently poised to expand East, if
only a couple states closer to me&mdash;hooray!). And of course, I've
been aware of their secret menu for years. I've eaten plenty of their
signature veggie-heavy, never-frozen, well-balanced, tangy-sauced
creations. I've even had them frozen and FedExed across the country in
order to recreate them at home (that particular experiment was a great
success, by the way). That said, last Sunday I found myself about to
attempt something that I've <em>never</em> done before.</p>

<p><strong>The Location:</strong> the In-N-Out near Sausalito, just out
of San Francisco.<br /> <strong>The Time:</strong> Sunday afternoon, 3
p.m.<br /> <strong>The Mission:</strong> Order and document every single
item and option on the menu, public, secret, super-duper-secret.</p>

<p>Anybody who's been halfway around the block is aware of In-N-Out's
secret menu, which allows you a few custom options other than the
regular hamburger, cheeseburger, fries, shakes, and Double-Double that
appear on their printed menus. But the options don't stop there.</p>

<p>Before I ever set foot in the store, I culled the Internet,
eventually stumbling upon the Davis County Wiki, which has a full
user-generated page devoted entirely to In-N-Out menu options. I drew up
a list that included about two dozen distinct menu items designed to
demonstrate the entire width and breadth of the custom options available
at your typical In-N-Out location before hopping into the car.</p>

<h4>The Options</h4>

<p>Along with the listed <strong>single</strong> and
<strong>double,</strong> you can add <strong>up to four patties</strong>
to any sandwich. Ask for a <strong>three by three</strong> or a
<strong>four by four,</strong> and what you get is a triple cheeseburger
or quadruple cheeseburger, respectively. They used to accommodate
sandwiches larger than 4 x 4 (check out a 100 x 100!), but no longer do.
I was fairly certain that they could also accommodate a 2 x 4 or a 4 x 2
(that'd be two patties, four slices of cheese, or four patties, two
slices of cheese), but hadn't actually tried it in action on an
unsuspecting cashier.</p>

<p>You can up the flavor by asking for any burger <strong>mustard
grilled.</strong> After cooking the first side, the cook will squirt
some mustard onto the top of the patty before flipping it so that it
sizzles into the meat on the grill. It's so good that I've started doing
it myself at home.</p>

<p>That said, there are those rare moments in life when all you want to
savor is the cheese. Order a <strong>grilled cheese,</strong> and what
you get is a soft toasted In-N-Out bun with two slices of American
cheese beautifully melted in between. I like to eat these with pickles.
If you ask for it, you can even get the standard lettuce, tomato, and
raw onion slices stacked inside.</p>

<p>Of course, those aren't your only veggie options. <strong>Grilled
onions</strong> cooked down in the collected meat juices on the hot
griddle can be added to any sandwich, and come standard if you ask for
your burger or fries <strong>Animal Style.</strong> An <strong>Animal
Style burger</strong> also includes extra Thousand Island spread,
mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. <strong>Animal Style
fries,</strong> on the other hand, are topped with cheese, spread, and
grilled onions. You'll want to mix 'em up with your fork before the
cheese starts to coagulate (of course, you can also ask for just plain
old <strong>cheese fries</strong>). And these options are just the
start.</p>

<h4>Personnel Issues</h4>

<p>With such a large and complex order, I figured the best strategy to
achieve my goals without getting kicked out of the restaurant would be
to order in waves, always including one simple, anchor sandwich (say, a
regular Double Double) along with a few of my "special" requests. My
first interaction with the bright-eyed, young cashier named Thomas went
easily enough.</p>

<p>"Welcome to In-N-Out."</p>

<p>"Hi&mdash;I want to make a kinda weird order, ok?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" he said, almost a little too brightly. I must remember
to shed my mistrusting New Yorker attitude.</p>

<p>"Ok. I'd like one regular cheeseburger, with everything on it. Then
I'd like one regular cheeseburger with <strong>chopped chilis.</strong>*
Oh, and could I also have a bag of <strong>chilis on the
side</strong>?** After that, I'll need a cheeseburger with everything,
<strong>split in half,</strong>*** along with an order of fries,
<strong>well done,</strong>**** if you can do that."</p>

<p>"Sure we can! Anything else?" He's totally unfazed.</p>

<p>"Uh yeah, I'll take a <strong>root beer float</strong>***** as well,
and... that's it for now."</p>

<p>"No problem. You'll be order number 4 today."</p>

<p><small>* That's super-hot pickled sport peppers chopped and pressed
into the bottom of the burger.<br /> ** A small bag with two whole sport
peppers.<br /> *** Any burger will be cut neatly in half upon
request.<br /> **** Fries cooked extra long.<br /> ***** Root beer with
vanilla ice cream</small></p>

<p>Our order arrived a few minutes later, produced <em>exactly</em> as
requested. Shocking! At my local McDonald's, the cashier has trouble
even getting a single cheeseburger right, never mind special
requests!</p>

<p>After documenting the goods, I went back for me second order.</p>

<p>"Hey&mdash;you're back. Still hungry?"</p>

<p>"Yep. I'm going to order a few more weird things."</p>

<p>"So, are you just trying to order everything on the menu?"</p>

<p><em>Sh*t</em>, I thought to myself. <em>The gig is up.</em></p>

<p>"Yeah...," I said sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Awesome! I've been waiting for this day ever since I started working
here!"</p>

<p><strong>Things just got a whole lot more fun.</strong> We proceeded
to spend the next 15 minutes poring over our options, colluding like
'80s kids in a clubhouse trading Garbage Pail Kids, expanding my
original list with Thomas' insider information.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Here's some more:</strong> If you don't like your onions
chopped, you might want to instead opt for a <strong>whole grilled
onion.</strong> Thomas was hyper-enthusiastic about this one, saying it
was his favorite, and describing the flavor as "almost diner-like." I've
got to concur. It's fantastic.</p>

<p>Buns come toasted, and burgers come medium-well by default. But you
can, of course, request that your bun come either <strong>no
toast</strong> or <strong>extra toast,</strong> the latter helping to
help protect it from excess burger juice. <span class="pullquote">Say
the magic words <strong>medium rare</strong>, and any burger can be
cooked so that it retains a nice pink center.</span> Don't worry, the
patty still manages to form some of that signature In-N-Out brown
crust.</p>

<p>As for those <strong>chopped chilis,</strong> I'm no amateur when it
comes to heat, but biting one of these diminutive fire-bombs in half
nearly brought me to tears. They're not for the faint-hearted!</p>

<p>Those who want to mix up the flavor of their condiments without
setting fire to their throats might instead want to just ask to
<strong>add mustard</strong> or <strong>add ketchup.</strong> I was
surprised when I found that you can opt out of the delicious Thousand
Island-style spread and instead go for the more familiar red and yellow
squirts. Thomas assured me that it was an uncommon request. By the way,
you can indeed order <strong>2 x 4</strong>'s or <strong>4 x
2</strong>'s, or even <strong>1 x 4</strong>'s if you are particularly
fond of American cheese.</p>

<p>"Some people even like their cheese unmelted," said Thomas, with an
air of disapproval. If you are this type, you can ask for <strong>cold
cheese.</strong></p>

<p>As we were working our way through the order, I noticed the couple
beside me asking for a <strong>veggie burger.</strong> If for some
reason you've decided to step into In-N-Out as a non-meat eater, no
worries, this is a hippie town after all. You can forgo all the
beefiness for a simple salad-in-a-bun. Also known as a <strong>wish
burger</strong> (as in, "I wish there was meat in this burger"), it's a
toasted bun piled high with hand-leafed lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and of
course, onions, spread, and pickles upon request.</p>

<p>If you really love veggies and really hate carbs, you can also get
your burger as a lettuce wrap by asking for it <strong>protein
style</strong>. Some idiosyncratic folk prefer to keep their roughage
and their meat in separate beds. If this adequately describes you, you
might consider ordering a <strong>salad on the side.</strong> Even
Thomas admitted that only a few of the deepest, inner-circle In-N-Out
employees will honor the request, but <span class="pullquote">you can
always hack your way to it by requesting extra lettuce, tomatoes, and
onions on the side.</span> It'll come tucked into a Double-double
wrapper. Ask for an extra packet of spread, and you've got yourself a
fully-seasoned daily-allowance of vegetables at no extra cost.</p>

<p>That should make you feel better about yourself when you tuck into
the meat and cheese fest known as the <strong>Flying
Dutchman</strong>&mdash;the ultimate Atkins-friendly menu item. Two
slices of cheese melted between two burger patties. No rabbit food, no
wimpy buns, just pure protein and fat. Want to kick up the manliness by
yet another factor? Ask for a <strong>Flying Dutchman Animal
Style</strong> and they'll add a scoop of diced onions to the cheese.
Pickles and spread will come on the side, so you'll have to add them
yourself. "I wish we could add the spread and pickles for you, but it's
just too messy for the cooks," explained an apologetic Thomas. The
result definitely wins the award for messiest menu item of all time.</p>

<p>Moving on to the liquid side of things, you have your standard choice
of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry milkshake (yes, they <em>will</em>
honor a request for a <strong>black & white</strong>). Ask for a
<strong>Neapolitan,</strong> and you get all three flavors in one
gloriously integrated and harmonious cup. Not big into shakes? The words
<strong>root beer float</strong> will get you a half cup of root beer
topped with a swirl of vanilla soft-serve.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that In-N-Out's fries are notoriously bad despite
being fresh cut in-house&mdash;it's because they only fry them once
instead of the superior McDonald's-style double-fry&mdash;but there are
ways to improve them. First, you can get them extra crispy by saying
<strong>well done.</strong> The fries turn out more dry and crunchy than
crispy with a fluffy center, but it's a definite improvement. If you're
on the opposite end of the spectrum, you can also request your fries
<strong>light,</strong> where they'll come to your tray almost
completely blond, limp, and greasy. I dunno. Some people like these,
apparently. Thomas corroborated the rumored accounts of customers who go
even more extreme; <span class="pullquote">one customer regularly
ordered <strong>two minute</strong> fries, which were still crunchy and
raw in the middle.</span></p>

<p><small><strong>Potential fry hack:</strong> Order a few trays of
in-n-out fries extra light, bring them home, then refry them yourself.
By resting them on the way home, they should be in perfect shape to
crisp up into perfect, double-fried fries by the time you get them into
your own kitchen, providing you with fresh, double-fried potatoes with
the tedious cutting and initial deep-frying work taken care of for
you.</small></p>

<p>And of course, if you want to gussy up your gear, all you've got to
do is ask for some <strong>stickers.</strong> You can get either the
classic In-N-Out crossed palm trees over a white background, or a
16-piece sticker-puzzle that features a couple of boys hiding behind a
car and being very naughty indeed.</p>

<p>As we wrapped up our order and he rung it in, Thomas confided that
"this was the coolest day I've ever had at work." I agreed. It
<em>was</em> a cool day, and I thought I was all done until I spied a
customer doing this:</p>

<p><strong>Genius.</strong> Like ice cream scooped onto apple pie,
shoving fries into a burger just makes sense, right?</p>

<p>I turned to Thomas one last time to make one final small request.
"I'd like one last cheeseburger please, with fries inside."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, we just can't do that."</p>

<p>I was floored. Of all the odd requests, this was the single one that
couldn't be fulfilled? Had our hand-in-hand menu-trotting adventure
meant nothing to him? Was he yet just another corporate shill kowtowing
to the man? Was the entire deep, burger-fueled connection that I
perceived between our souls nothing but a a lie, as fragile and hollow
as a well-done fry? He must have seen the devastation on my face because
he quickly continued with, "but I'd be happy to order you another
cheeseburger and fries and you can put them in your sandwich yourself.
I'll give you some extra napkins. <strong>And would you and your friends
all like some In-N-Out hats?</strong>"</p>

<p>Yes ,Thomas, yes we would, I said softly, dabbing at the
onion-scented tears that suddenly welled up in the corners of my eyes
with greasy spread-covered fingers. This time it wasn't from the
chilis.</p>

<p>We left the store positively high on good burgers and even better
service and spent the next hour on the beach at Golden Gate Park staring
into the sea and pondering how great the world would be if every fast
food experience could be as uplifting.</p>
