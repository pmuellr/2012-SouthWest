<p>At In-N-Out you can order custom-made food. Some customizations are available at no additional cost; those that use inventoried items such as cheese, meat, and buns cost extra. While it's not on the printed menu, there are buttons on the cash register for these items. You can pretty much order anything you want, as long as they have the ingredients (e.g., putting onions in a milkshake). While the "secret" menu is listed on the In-N-Out corporate site, it is far from complete.
<p>Also, keep in mind that since you can customize anything, you can feel free to order whatever you want and create your own "double-secret personal menu". Get a 0x3 with four slice of tomato on a double toasted bun and call it a "cheesy wiki". The following are just the custom orders that are popular enough to go by well known names.
<h2>Burgers</h2>
<p>
<strong>Stock:</strong> If you ordered your burgers off the menu they would come with: 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a spread similar to thousand island dressing. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one slice of tomato (two if one won't cover the entire bottom bun) 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a portion of lettuce 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Onions are always offered when you order. They come as a fresh slice by default, but chopped raw, chopped grilled, and whole grilled onions are available by request. The amount is constant regardless of the number of meat patties unless you ask for extra or lite of a condiment.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>but instead consider ...</em> 

<h2>Custom Burgers</h2>
<p>Note: Many of these styles can be ordered in combination (for example, Double-Double Animal Style No Salt).
<p>
  <strong>This section would be awesome if it had pictures for each option. Add them if you have them. Or have an adventure next time you go to In-N-Out and order one of these you haven't had before!</strong> 

<p>
<strong>Animal style</strong> is the most popular "secret" style. In addition to the standard toppings, animal style burgers include: 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>pickles 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extra spread 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grilled onions instead of fresh onion 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mustard fried onto each meat patty.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Protein style</strong> , popular among Atkins dieters, no/low carb eaters and people who just like lots of lettuce: 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>replaces the hamburger bun with large leaves of lettuce. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be combined with other special orders, e.g., animal protein style. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lettuce is generally colder than buns, so beware of quickly-congealing beef grease in the sandwich.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3x3, 4x4,</strong> or generally 
<strong>M x C</strong> refers to a burger with a varied number of meat patties (first number, M) and slices of cheese (second number, C). For example, the popular Double-Double would be 2x2 (pronounced "Two-by-two" when you order it), while a burger with 3 meat patties and 1 slice of cheese would be a 3x1 (a "three-by-one").
<ul>
  <p>As of August 2006, the largest burger that can be ordered is a 4x4. Only four slices of cheese maximum may be permitted on a single burger. That may be a Davis-specific rule, as somebody checked and officially the largest you can order is a 4x6. If you are wondering about ordering a 20x20, look at this link to deter you. It is a photo essay of the terrible 20 patty journey. Or, to even better satisfy any curiosity you may have, the 100x100.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Double-Meat</strong> (a.k.a. 2x0) is a Double-Double with no cheese. 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>By definition a Double-Double automatically includes two slices of cheese; for two patties without the cheese, a double meat burger must be ordered.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>The Flying Dutchman</strong> : 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two meat patties 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>two slices of cheese 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no bun 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Note: other condiments (including lettuce, tomato, spread, and onions) are not included unless you request them. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a great way to circumvent the burger size rules. i.e.: order a 4x4 and two Flying Dutchmans and you have essentially an 8x8
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Grilled Cheese:</strong> 
  <br>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a sandwich with two slices of cheese 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no meat 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the grilled cheese comes stock, with spread, tomatoes, lettuce, and onions if you would like. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Like most orders, this can be combined with other styles such as animal style. 
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>FYI: The grilled cheese used to be cooked on the side of the grill that was reserved for toasting buns (so that it wouldn't get contaminated from being cooked on the same surface used to cook meat). They now have two separate grills, one for meat, and the other for bun toasting. However, the bun grill is coated with a special non-stick surface that doesn't allow them to cook grilled cheeses on it any longer, and they have to cook them on the same surface as the meat.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Veggie Burger</strong> or 
<strong>Wish Burger:</strong> 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A sandwich containing only vegetables, and no meat or cheese. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>"Wish burger" is a reference to Rubber Biscuit, which was a massive cult hit due to Dan Aykroyd's performance of it as Elwood Blues. The song is a lament about not having enough money for food, and going hungry. The majority of the lyrics are nonsensical vocal sounds, with one of the four actual lines being: "Have you ever heard of a wish sandwich? A wish sandwich is the kind of a sandwich where you have two slices of bread and you — hum hum hum hum — 
    <em>wish</em> you had some 
    <em>meat</em> !"
  </li>
</ul>

  <h3>Burger Options</h3>
</span>
<p>
<strong>Mustard fried</strong> patty spread with mustard, then cooked. This also adds pickles, unless you tell them to hold the pickles. You can also ask for heavy mustard fried.
<p>
<strong>Chopped chilis</strong> adds some yellow chilies to the bottom of your burger. Medium heat, little bit of vinegar flavor. (You can also ask for these on the side!)
<p>
<strong>Mustard</strong> and/or 
<strong>ketchup</strong> can be substituted for the spread. 
<strong>Only</strong> designates no spread. Cashiers may ask if you want ketchup or mustard instead.
<p>
<strong>No-salt</strong> has no salt added to the the patties. Once you add the condiments and cheese, you don't need the extra salt anyway and you can leave without feeling like a dried-out-but-satisfied lump.
<p>
<strong>Extra toasted bun/lightly toasted bun/untoasted bun</strong> . The bun come toasted by default, but you can ask to have the level of toastyness varied. The buns are toasted to add some rigidity to the burger, as an untoasted bun is flimsy under the weight of all the meat/cheese/condiments. This also prevents sauces and toppings from excessively soaking into the bun, thereby avoiding the last-bites-are-soggy problem. This needs to be the first modification requested, based on keystroke order into the register.
<p>
<strong>Extra everything</strong> - Extra tomatoes, extra lettuce, extra onion, extra spread, extra pickles, extra onions, extra chilis. You can ask for all of these at no extra charge. They'll really fill out your burger and make it a more balanced meal, especially if you're a veggie fan. Onions can come in four ways: whole raw, whole grilled, chopped grilled (like animal style) and chopped raw. You can also ask for 
<em>both</em> raw and grilled onions in the same burger.
<p>
<strong>Medium rare</strong> or 
<strong>well done</strong> . You can specify how well done your hamburger patties are. FYI: Medium rare will definitely show a pink middle.
